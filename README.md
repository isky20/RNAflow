Purpose: RNAflow is a bioinformatics pipeline for processing RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data.
Workflow: Converts raw FastQ files (FQs) into differentially expressed genes (DEGs).
Implementation: Built using Nextflow, which enables reproducibility and scalability.
Programming Languages: Incorporates Python, R, and Shell scripts.
âœ…Functionality:
- Automates RNA-seq data analysis.
- Ensures a streamlined and reproducible workflow.
- Identifies DEGs from raw sequencing reads.
